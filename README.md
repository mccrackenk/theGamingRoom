Portfolio submission for CS230

The Gaming Room client required the development of a web-based game application named "Draw It or Lose It." This application was an adaptation of an
existing Android app and involved multiple teams competing to guess a puzzle based on stock drawings. The key client requirements included allowing one 
or more teams to participate, with multiple players assigned to each team, ensuring uniqueness for game and team names to prevent conflicts, and implementing
unique identifiers for games, teams, and players to manage instances effectively.

In developing this documentation, one aspect that was handled effectively was addressing the client's requirements clearly and concisely. The documentation provided
a comprehensive overview of the client's needs, ensuring a common understanding of the project's scope. The design constraints, system architecture view, and domain 
model were also well-defined, offering a structured foundation for the development process.

The process of working through the design document was immensely helpful in guiding the development process. It provided a clear roadmap for software architecture, 
technology stack, and security considerations. Having a well-documented plan ensured that the coding process was more organized and aligned with the client's expectations.

If I were to revise one part of this work, I would focus on enhancing the clarity and detail of the Domain Model section. While it provides a good starting point for
understanding class relationships, providing more context and details about the purpose and responsibilities of each class would make it even more valuable.

Interpreting the user's needs and implementing them into the software design was crucial for ensuring that the final product met the client's expectations. 
It's essential to consider the user's needs because software is ultimately created for users, and understanding their requirements and preferences is fundamental for 
delivering a successful product.

Approaching software design involved a structured and modular approach. The use of design constraints helped in making informed decisions about architecture, 
scalability, security, real-time interaction, and data integrity. For future software applications, I would continue to use a similar approach, emphasizing user-centered design, 
real-time features, and robust security measures while being adaptable to technology advancements and changing user needs.
